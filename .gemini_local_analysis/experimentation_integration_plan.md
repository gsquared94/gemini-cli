### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup

1.  **Create a new package for experimentation:**
    - A new package named `experimentation` will be created within the
      `packages/` directory. This will encapsulate all logic related to fetching
      and managing experimental flags.
    - This package will have its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and will
      be added to the root `package.json` workspaces.

2.  **Define Core Interfaces:**
    - Create an `interfaces.ts` file inside `packages/experimentation/src/` to
      define the data structures for the `ListExperiments` RPC. This will
      include:
      - `ListExperimentsResponseParameters`
      - `FlagParameters`
      - `FilteredFlag`
      - `ExperimentOverrides` (a mapped object of experiment names to their
        values)
    - These interfaces will be based on the existing implementation in the
      `vscode` project.

### Phase 2: Building the Experimentation Service

1.  **Create an Abstract `ExperimentProvider`:**
    - An abstract class or interface `ExperimentProvider` will be created. It
      will define a contract for different experiment fetching mechanisms.
    - It will have a primary method,
      `getExperimentFlags(): Promise<ExperimentOverrides>`.

2.  **Implement `ListExperimentsProvider`:**
    - A `ListExperimentsProvider` class will be created that implements
      `ExperimentProvider`.
    - This class will be responsible for making the HTTP call to the
      `ListExperiments` endpoint when the authentication method is OAuth.
    - It will handle the logic of constructing the request and parsing the
      response, similar to the `vscode` project's `ExperimentationService`.

3.  **Develop the `ExperimentationService`:**
    - This central service will manage the experiment providers and the
      lifecycle of the experiment flags. Its responsibilities will be:
      - Detecting the current authentication type (OAuth, API Key, etc.).
      - Selecting the appropriate `ExperimentProvider` based on the auth type.
        For now, it will only use `ListExperimentsProvider` for OAuth.
      - Fetching, caching, and providing the experiment flags to the rest of the
        application.
      - Handling the reset of experiment flags when the authentication type
        changes or the user logs out. This will be achieved by listening to
        authentication events.

### Phase 3: Integration with `gemini-cli`

1.  **Integrate with the Authentication System:**
    - The `packages/cli/src/auth/` directory, which manages authentication, will
      be modified.
    - The `ExperimentationService` will be initialized alongside the `Auth`
      service.
    - Event listeners will be set up to trigger the `ExperimentationService` to
      fetch flags upon a successful OAuth login and to clear them on logout.

2.  **Integrate with the Configuration System:**
    - The configuration loading mechanism in `packages/core/src/config/` will be
      updated.
    - A new layer will be introduced in the configuration hierarchy to
      accommodate the experimental flags. The order of precedence will be:
      1.  Command-line flags (highest)
      2.  Experiment flags from `ExperimentationService`
      3.  User-defined configuration from `config.yaml`
      4.  Default values (lowest)

3.  **Update the Command-Line Interface:**
    - The CLI commands will be updated to read from the new, layered
      configuration system. This will ensure that they respect the overridden
      values from the `ListExperiments` RPC.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    - Unit tests will be written for the `ListExperimentsProvider`, mocking the
      HTTP client to simulate different RPC responses.
    - The `ExperimentationService` will be tested to ensure it correctly selects
      the provider and manages the flag lifecycle.
    - Tests will be added to the configuration system to verify the override
      logic and precedence.

2.  **Integration Tests:**
    - An integration test will be created to simulate a full login flow and
      verify that the `ListExperiments` flags are fetched and applied correctly
      to a test command.

This plan ensures a modular and extensible integration of the `ListExperiments`
RPC, respecting all the requirements for configuration overrides and
auth-specific behavior.
